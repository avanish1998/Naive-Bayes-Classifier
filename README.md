# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis

The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem which gives us the probability of event c happening given event x has occurred.

The classifier achieved an accuracy of almost 0.85 which is pretty satisfactory. We have assumed that the features are independent which may not be true in real life. 
This hinders the performance of the classifier.
